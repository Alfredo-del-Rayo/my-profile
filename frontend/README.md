# Personal Profile

This single-page application (SPA) serves as my personal profile, developed using the Deno JavaScript runtime and the Vite.js framework for a fast and modern development workflow. The backend is built with Oak, providing a secure and lightweight HTTP server architecture.

## Home

The Home section introduces my personal culture, core values, and a collection of interview FAQs to help visitors understand my mindset, work philosophy, and problem-solving approach. It establishes a human connection while maintaining a professional tone that reflects both my technical and personal side.

## Resume

The Resume section contains my professional resume, highlighting my experience, education, and technical skills. It is designed for easy viewing while ensuring the underlying PDF documents are securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.

## Projects

The Projects section showcases the major work I have completed, focusing on innovation, scalability, and secure development practices. It is password protected, and the server uses a secure hashing mechanism with 14 salt rounds to verify access credentials. This ensures that only hiring managers and authorized individuals can view the full project portfolio.

This section also demonstrates my React proficiency, featuring real-time session updates, interactive UI components, and dynamic behaviors—including a carousel for project previews, animated transitions, and responsive layouts. Access control mechanisms further ensure that private project materials and PDF documents remain secure while maintaining a polished and engaging user experience.
